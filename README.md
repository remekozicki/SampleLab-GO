# Samples Management System for Specialist Laboratory

## Project Overview
The Samples Management System is a comprehensive web application designed to modernize and streamline the management of food samples in a specialized laboratory environment. The system replaces outdated spreadsheet-based tracking with a fully integrated, secure, and automated solution, improving workflow efficiency and reducing the risk of data loss or errors.

### Objectives
- **Replace Excel-based tracking**: Eliminate the limitations of spreadsheet management by introducing a centralized database system.
- **Automate repetitive tasks**: Reduce manual data entry by automating sample registration, test assignment, and report generation.
- **Improve data security and accessibility**: Ensure data integrity and user authentication to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Enhance reporting capabilities**: Provide automated report generation for regulatory compliance and operational insights.
- **Optimize laboratory workflow**: Streamline sample tracking from registration to testing and reporting.

## Features
### Sample Management
- Register new samples with all necessary metadata.
- Assign specific analyses to samples.
- Track the status of ongoing tests.
- Update and delete sample records as needed.

### Test Assignment and Processing
- Assign multiple tests to a single sample.
- Monitor test progress and results in real time.
- Allow authorized users to input and modify test results.
- Implement test validation procedures for quality assurance.

### Reporting and Data Export
- Generate standard laboratory reports, including:
  - Test result summaries
  - Batch processing reports
  - Regulatory compliance reports
- Export data in CSV format for external processing.
- Generate quarterly and annual reports on sample statistics and testing performance.

### User Authentication and Role Management
- Secure login system with multi-level user access.
- Assign roles such as Administrator, Lab Technician, and Analyst.
- Ensure controlled access to sensitive data based on user roles.

### System Security and Backup
- Implement authentication with Spring Security.
- Encrypt sensitive data to prevent unauthorized access.
- Perform regular automatic backups of the database.
- Ensure secure data transmission with HTTPS encryption.

## Technology Stack
The system is built using modern and scalable technologies:

### Backend
- **Language**: Java
- **Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Database Management**: PostgreSQL
- **Security**: Spring Security
- **Data Processing**: JPA/Hibernate

### Frontend
- **Library**: React.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **UI Components**: Material UI

### Infrastructure and Deployment
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Task Management**: Jira

## System Architecture
The application follows a three-tier architecture to ensure modularity and scalability:
1. **Frontend (Client-side)**: A React.js application that provides a user-friendly interface for laboratory personnel.
2. **Backend (Server-side)**: A Spring Boot API that handles business logic, data processing, and security.
3. **Database Layer**: A PostgreSQL database that securely stores all laboratory data.

## Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
To install and run the application, ensure you have the following:
- **Java 17+** installed for backend execution.
- **Node.js and npm** installed for frontend development.
- **PostgreSQL** database set up with the necessary schema.
- **Docker** installed (if using containerized deployment).

### Running the Application
#### Using Docker (Recommended)
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <project_directory>
   ```
2. Start the application using Docker:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

#### Manual Setup
1. Start the PostgreSQL database and create the necessary schema.
2. Configure the database connection in the Spring Boot application (`application.properties`).
3. Start the backend service:
   ```sh
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
4. Navigate to the frontend directory, install dependencies, and start the frontend server:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Usage Guide
1. **Login to the system** using valid credentials.
2. **Register new samples** and assign tests.
3. **Monitor sample status** and update results.
4. **Generate reports** and export data as needed.
5. **Manage users and permissions** to ensure security.

## Development and Contribution
- The project follows **Scrum methodology** for agile development.
- **Jira** is used for issue tracking and sprint planning.
- **GitHub** is used for version control and collaborative development.
- All contributions must go through a pull request and code review before merging.

## Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Data Visualization**: Introduce charts and graphs for better insights.
- **Mobile App Integration**: Develop a mobile version for field sample collection.
- **AI-Based Analysis**: Implement machine learning for automated anomaly detection in test results.
- **System Integration**: Enable API integrations with other laboratory systems.
